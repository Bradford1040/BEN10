[verify_heater heater_bed]
max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
check_gain_time: 90
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 2.

[z_thermal_adjust]
temp_coeff: 0.0
#   The temperature coefficient of expansion, in mm/degC. For example, a
#   temp_coeff of 0.01 mm/degC will move the Z axis downwards by 0.01 mm for
#   every degree Celsius that the temperature sensor increases. Defaults to
#   0.0 mm/degC, which applies no adjustment.
smooth_time: 2.0
#   Smoothing window applied to the temperature sensor, in seconds. Can reduce
#   motor noise from excessive small corrections in response to sensor noise.
#   The default is 2.0 seconds.
z_adjust_off_above: 99999999.0
#   Disables adjustments above this Z height [mm]. The last computed correction
#   will remain applied until the toolhead moves below the specified Z height
#   again. The default is 99999999.0 mm (always on).
max_z_adjustment: 99999999.0
#   Maximum absolute adjustment that can be applied to the Z axis [mm]. The
#   default is 99999999.0 mm (unlimited).

#[endstop_phase stepper_z]
#endstop_accuracy:
#   Sets the expected accuracy (in mm) of the endstop. This represents
#   the maximum error distance the endstop may trigger (eg, if an
#   endstop may occasionally trigger 100um early or up to 100um late
#   then set this to 0.200 for 200um). The default is
#   4*rotation_distance/full_steps_per_rotation.
#trigger_phase:
#   This specifies the phase of the stepper motor driver to expect
#   when hitting the endstop. It is composed of two numbers separated
#   by a forward slash character - the phase and the total number of
#   phases (eg, "7/64"). Only set this value if one is sure the
#   stepper motor driver is reset every time the mcu is reset. If this
#   is not set, then the stepper phase will be detected on the first
#   home and that phase will be used on all subsequent homes.
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   If true then the position_endstop of the axis will effectively be
#   modified so that the zero position for the axis occurs at a full
#   step on the stepper motor. (If used on the Z axis and the print
#   layer height is a multiple of a full step distance then every
#   layer will occur on a full step.) The default is False.

#[homing_override]
#gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of G28 commands
#   found in the normal g-code input. See docs/Command_Templates.md
#   for G-Code format. If a G28 is contained in this list of commands
#   then it will invoke the normal homing procedure for the printer.
#   The commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#axes: xyz
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the
#   override script will only be run when the z axis is homed (eg, via
#   a "G28" or "G28 Z0" command). Note, the override script should
#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z:
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.


#[bed_tilt]
#x_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the X
#   axis. The default is 0.
#y_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the Y
#   axis. The default is 0.
#z_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to the Z height when the nozzle is nominally at
#   0, 0. The default is 0.
# The remaining parameters control a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that may be used to calibrate appropriate x and y
# adjustment parameters.
#points:
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE
#   command. Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe
#   is above the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. The default is
#   to not enable the command.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
